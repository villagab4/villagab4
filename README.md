### Howdy 🤠

I'm Gabe, Co-founder & CTO of [GovEagle](https://www.goveagle.com) - a YC-backed startup using Generative AI to help government contractors win more awards.

Previously built ML models to detect money laundering at Stripe and researched AI-based glaucoma prognostication at Johns Hopkins. You can check out my [research here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5ww9EbMAAAAJ&hl=en).

I love working with LLMs, building distributed systems, and solving challenging backend/infrastructure problems. Python is my go-to, but I'm also comfortable with TypeScript, C++, and Java.
